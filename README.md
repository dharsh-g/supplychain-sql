### Analysis and Recommendation

Supplier Performance Analysis:
 ● Analyze the total revenue generated by each supplier to identify top-performing
 suppliers.
 ● Evaluate the average delivery time for shipments from different suppliers to assess
 logistics efficiency.
 ● Identify suppliers with declining order trends or inconsistent performance over time for
 further investigation and potential collaboration opportunities.
 2. Inventory Optimization:
 ● Review inventory levels for each product and identify items with low stock levels (e.g.,
 less than 50 units).
 ● Implement inventory forecasting models to predict demand and ensure optimal stock
 levels to meet customer demand without excessive inventory holding costs.
 ● Establish reordering thresholds and automate replenishment processes to maintain
 adequate inventory levels while minimizing stockouts.
